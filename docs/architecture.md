# Architecture

This document outlines the technical architecture of the ITIL Knowledge & Collaboration Portal.

## System Overview

The portal is a monolithic web application built with the Django web framework. It is containerized using Docker and designed to be deployed on various platforms, from local machines to cloud environments.

## Components

### 1. Web Application (Backend)

*   **Framework:** Django
*   **Language:** Python
*   **Description:** The core of the application, responsible for handling business logic, serving web pages, and providing a REST API for potential future frontend clients. It includes the following Django apps:
    *   `users`: Manages users, roles, and permissions (RBAC).
    *   `knowledge_base`: Manages "How-To" articles, FAQs, tagging, and versioning.
    *   `itil_processes`: Manages the ITIL best practices repository.

### 2. Database

*   **Type:** PostgreSQL
*   **Description:** A relational database used to store all application data, including users, articles, and ITIL process guidelines.

### 3. Web Server

*   **Type:** Django development server (for local development). For production, a more robust server like Gunicorn or uWSGI would be used, typically behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.

### 4. Containerization

*   **Technology:** Docker, Docker Compose
*   **Description:** The application and its dependencies are packaged into Docker containers. Docker Compose is used to orchestrate the containers for local development.

## Deployment

*   **Local:** The application can be run locally using Docker Compose.
*   **Cloud:** The Docker-based architecture allows for deployment on various cloud platforms:
    *   **AWS:** ECS, EKS
    *   **GCP:** Cloud Run, GKE
    *   **Azure:** App Service, AKS

## CI/CD

*   **Pipeline:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD can be used to automate testing and deployment. A typical pipeline would include:
    1.  **Linting & Static Analysis:** Check code quality.
    2.  **Unit & Integration Tests:** Run the test suite.
    3.  **Build Docker Image:** Build and push the image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR, GCR).
    4.  **Deploy:** Deploy the new image to the target environment.
